Next we move on to superconducting heterostructures. We begin with the fractional Chern fractional topological insulator slab $\mathcal{F}$ in \eqref{FTIFSFS} and introduce weak superconducting pairing, perhaps induced by proximity with a bulk superconductor, without closing the bulk energy gap. In the simplest scenario, this condenses all parton pairs $\psi^{2m}$, which form a {\em Lagrangian subgroup}~\cite{Levin13} -- a maximal set of mutually local bosons -- containing the Cooper pair $\psi_{\mathrm{el}}^2=\psi^{2(2n+1)}$. Since the parton pair $\psi^2$ carries gauge charge $2g$, which is relatively prime with $2n+1$, the condensate confines all non-trivial dyons $\gamma^m$, which are non-local and have non-trivial monodromy with $\psi^2$. As the neutral sector $\mathbb{Z}_{2n+1}^{(2a)}$ is killed by pairing, the superconducting fractional topological insulator slab with time reversal conjugate ferromagnetic surfaces has a simple fermionic topological order. It however it still carries chiral fermionic edge modes with the same chiral central charge $c_{\mathcal{F}}$. On the other hand, these fermionic channels also live along the line interface between time reversal conjugate ferromagnetic domains on the surface of a weakly superconducting fractional topological insulator. When the line interface hits a time reversal symmetric superconducting surface island (c.f.~ Fig.~\ref{fig1} by replacing the \TPf surfaces by superconducting surfaces), these chiral channels split and divide along the pair of superconducting surface-ferromagnetic surface line interfaces. Both of these channels are electrically neutral as charge $U(1)$ symmetry is broken by the superconductor, and each of them carries half of the energy current of $\mathcal{F}$ and has chiral central charge $c_{\mathcal{F}}/2$. For example, the superconducting surface-ferromagnetic surface heterostructure on a conventional toplogical insulator surface holds a chiral Majorana channel with $c=1/2$ along the line tri-junction~\cite{FuKanechargetransport09,TeoKane}. In the specific fractional case when $a=-1$ and $g=-2$, each superconducting surface-ferromagnetic surface line interfaces holds $2n+1$ chiral Majorana fermions and is described by the Wess-Zumino-Witten $SO(2n+1)_1$ conformal field theory with the central charge $c=(2n+1)/2$. Analogous to the conventional superconducting topological insulator surface~\cite{FuKane08}, the superconducting surface of the fractional topological insulator supports a zero energy Majorana bound state (\hypertarget{MBS}{MBS}) at a vortex core. Now that the condensate consists of parton pairs, vortices are quantized with the magnetic flux $hc/2e^\ast=(2n+1)hc/2e$. Each pair of majorana bound states form a two-level system distinguished by parton fermion parity.
