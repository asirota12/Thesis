These two works are being continued. We are investigating further in two new papers exploring
1) What is the topological order in this new interacting Weyl phase~\cite{SirotaRazaTeoappearsoon}?
2) How can we describe the $\nu=1/2(2n+1)$ state from electron operators using a coupled wire description?
I believe this will be influential in describing a new sequence of quantum hall states, and as a useful tool to understanding Dirac, Weyl, and nodal semi-metals.
